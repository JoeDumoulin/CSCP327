#CPSC 327 Artificial Intelligence Spring 2015: Assignment 7#

In this assignment your team will participate in a data programming contest and attempt to get high scores predicting a classification of data related to survivors of the Titanic disaster.  

To complete this Assignment follow the steps below.

1. To begin the assignment, go to [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted).  check out the links on the left side of the page for information on the contest.  Make sure you understand how to download the data.  To complete part 1 of the assignment, you should download the data, read the contest description, evaluation, rules, and Frequently Asked Questions.  We will discuss in class.  This part of the Assignment should be done by **Friday, April 10**.  During this part of the assignment, **one member of your team should sign up for a kaggle account** to allow submissions to the contest.  The name of the team should be given to me so that I can keep track of your progress.

2. In the second part of this assignment, we get the software installed and get down to the business of Macine Learning.  You will begin by reading the page [Getting Started With Excel](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/details/getting-started-with-excel).  We won't actually use excel but the information on this page is good prep for the following work.
Next you will read [Getting Started With Python](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/details/getting-started-with-python) and [Getting Started With Python II](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/details/getting-started-with-python-ii), installing all the required software and trying the problems.  This section is really helpful for understanding how to work with data and how to create graphs in python.  This should be completed by **April 17**. 
 
3. The remainder of the project is to build and refine a machine learning model of the Titanic data set using techinques like logistic regression, neural networks, and random forest.  We will also work on regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and we will dicuss measures to help you understand false negative and false positive behavior in your model's predictions.  Your team's results will be submitted to the leaderboard for the Titanic contest to see how you rank with the other participants.  You should complete this by **April 24**.
