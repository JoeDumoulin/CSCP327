#CPSC 327 Artificial Intelligence Spring 2015: Assignment 6#

In this assignment you will use the constraint programming library clpfd to solve a sudoku puzzle using prolog.  The clpfd library will give you the tools you need to formulate constraints and solve the puzzle.

In order to understand constraint logic and constraint programming, you should take a look at the following reading.

- [clpfd prolog tutorial](http://www.pathwayslms.com/swipltuts/clpfd/clpfd.html) - This document will help you with lots of examples and explanation of how to write simple programs with clpfd and prolog.  
- [clpfd documentation](http://www.swi-prolog.org/man/clpfd.html) - You will find it useful to scan this documentation to look for examples of how to use the various functions.
