#CPSC 327 Artificial Intelligence Spring 2015: Assignment 4#

Now that we've loked at the basics of prolog, this assignment will give you a chance to play with prolog's list syntax.  

Before you begin this assignment, read the documentation on the [Learn prolog Now!](http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-html) pages for chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6.  These chapters are short and should be fairly easy.  We will also be covering much of this material in class.

After reading through this material, your assignment is to create a prolog file with clauses for accomplishing the following tasks:

 1. Find the length of a list.
 2. Find the sum of a list of numbers.
 3. given a list of lists (for example, [[a],[b,c,d],[d,e,f]]), flatten the list (for the example, the result would be [a,b,c,d,e,f]).
 4. reverse all the items in a list.  If the list is [1,2,3,4,5,6], then produce [6,5,4,3,2,1].

 place these in a .pl file.  I will have test data that I will use to test your program for correct results.
 
 This assignment will be due on **March 6**.
