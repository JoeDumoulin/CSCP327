#CPSC 327 Artificial Intelligence Spring 2015: Assignment 3#

Prolog is a language specially designed for logic programming.  Prolog is an important part of the history of AI.  Though it is not used as often as it was in the past, it is still important to understand.  This assignment is to help you understand the basics of prolog programming.  In this assignment you will:
	
1. Install and learn to run swi-prolog.  There are lots of resources for this:
 - [Windows](http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable) or [here is a nice tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1aA6xnXDh0)
 - [debian or ubuntu linux](http://www.swi-prolog.org/build/Debian.html)
 - [mac osx](http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable) 
2. Read and understand the first chapter of [Learn Prolog Now!](http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pageid=online).  Do the exercises.  They will help.
3. Load and run the knowledge base family.pl.

Once you have gotten this far, you should be able to answer the following questions.  The answers should be in the form of output from a prolog query with possibly some text explanations.  Just cut and paste the prolog results into a .md file and add the explanations as needed.  

1. Give the prolog query and the output for the question "Who is michael's father?"
2. Write a query parent(X,Y) to find the parent or child in the tree.
3. Write a prolog query that gives all of michael's grandfathers.
4. Modify the query in 2 to find any grandparents or grandchildren.
5. Write a query for discovering siblings in the family tree.  run it on some examples and check for problems.  If there are problems with the query, explain why and try to fix the problems.

This assignment will be due on **Feb 27**.
